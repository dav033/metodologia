# metodologia — Decision log

_Append-only. Newest at the bottom. Never delete or rewrite an entry: when a decision changes, add a new one
with `Supersedes: D-xxx` and edit only the old entry's `Status` line to `Superseded by D-yyy`._

<!-- Entry format:
## D-001 — <short title>
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD · **Status:** Accepted | Superseded by D-xxx | Reverted
- **Context:** why this came up
- **Decision:** what we chose
- **Alternatives:** option — why rejected
- **Consequences:** + good / − cost or risk
- **Source:** [day log](YYYY-MM/Wn/YYYY-MM-DD.md) · REQ-xxx (if any)

## D-001 — No guard hook limiting the executor
- **Date:** 2026-10-08 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Research recommended a PreToolUse hook blocking destructive commands (force push, `reset --hard`, `rm -rf` outside the repo, reading `.env`/`~/.ssh`), since the Claude sandbox doesn't run on native Windows.
- **Decision:** Not adopted. The user wants agents without limitations; safety stays in the skill's prose rules (stop-and-ask list) plus secret scanning.
- **Alternatives:** guard hook (rejected by the user: "no quiero limitaciones"); devcontainer/WSL sandbox for executors (not pursued).
- **Consequences:** + full autonomy, no false blocks / − destructive mistakes are only prevented by instructions.

## D-002 — One private monorepo for skill + bitácora
- **Date:** 2026-10-08 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Work happens on several computers; skill and bitácora were local-only.
- **Decision:** `github.com/dav033/metodologia` (private) holds `skill/` and `bitacora/`; junctions keep the usual paths; `install.py` sets up any machine; bitácora auto-commits (scoped) and pushes, pulls at session start.
- **Alternatives:** two repos (rejected: nothing will be shared; simpler with one); company org for Sempertex docs (not needed per user).
- **Consequences:** + one clone, versions aligned / − all project docs in one repo (fine: private, not shared).

## D-003 — Hefesto retired; everything moves to metodologia
- **Date:** 2026-10-08 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** eventos migrated (hefesto/ kept as archive); hefesto skill links removed (code intact in ~/hefesto).

## D-004 — Graphs: derive from our own IDs, no knowledge-graph database
- **Date:** 2026-10-08 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Research (2025–2026) shows modest/mixed evidence for graph context; KG stacks (Graphiti, GraphRAG, cognee) need infra and LLM edge extraction of links the bitácora already declares.
- **Decision:** a stdlib trace graph built from IDs (REQ/US/R/T/D/P), commits and files, with lint + web view; optional CodeGraph MCP for code navigation, A/B-tested first.
