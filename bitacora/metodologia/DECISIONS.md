## D-001 — No guard hook limiting the executor
- **Date:** 2026-10-08 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Research recommended a PreToolUse hook blocking destructive commands (force push, `reset --hard`, `rm -rf` outside the repo, reading `.env`/`~/.ssh`), since the Claude sandbox doesn't run on native Windows.
- **Decision:** Not adopted. The user wants agents without limitations; safety stays in the skill's prose rules (stop-and-ask list) plus secret scanning.
- **Alternatives:** guard hook (rejected by the user: "no quiero limitaciones"); devcontainer/WSL sandbox for executors (not pursued).
- **Consequences:** + full autonomy, no false blocks / − destructive mistakes are only prevented by instructions.

## D-002 — One private monorepo for skill + bitácora
- **Date:** 2026-10-08 · **Status:** Superseded by D-007
- **Context:** Work happens on several computers; skill and bitácora were local-only.
- **Decision:** `github.com/dav033/metodologia` (private) holds `skill/` and `bitacora/`; junctions keep the usual paths; `install.py` sets up any machine; bitácora auto-commits (scoped) and pushes, pulls at session start.
- **Alternatives:** two repos (rejected: nothing will be shared; simpler with one); company org for Sempertex docs (not needed per user).
- **Consequences:** + one clone, versions aligned / − all project docs in one repo (fine: private, not shared).

## D-003 — Hefesto retired; everything moves to metodologia
- **Date:** 2026-10-08 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** eventos migrated (hefesto/ kept as archive); hefesto skill links removed (code intact in ~/hefesto).
- **Source:** [eventos day log](../eventos/2026-10/W2/2026-10-08.md)

## D-004 — Graphs: derive from our own IDs, no knowledge-graph database
- **Date:** 2026-10-08 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Research (2025–2026) shows modest/mixed evidence for graph context; KG stacks (Graphiti, GraphRAG, cognee) need infra and LLM edge extraction of links the bitácora already declares.
- **Decision:** a stdlib trace graph built from IDs (REQ/US/R/T/D/P), commits and files, with lint + web view; optional CodeGraph MCP for code navigation, A/B-tested first.

## D-005 — Antagonist gate before every commit, parent decides
- **Date:** 2026-10-09 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** The user wants harsh architectural review before each commit without infinite loops.
- **Decision:** `antagonist` subagent reviews the staged diff; the parent agent triages each finding — fix if relevant now, otherwise defer to PENDING.md (urgency × complexity) or drop. One review + at most one re-review per commit; the antagonist can't delegate or edit.
- **Alternatives:** blocking review until clean (rejected: loops, interruptions).
- **Consequences:** + design issues caught pre-commit, deferred work tracked / − extra tokens and time per commit.

## D-006 — Multi-day runs: marathon supervisor, fresh session per task
- **Date:** 2026-10-09 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** /goal and /loop alone can't run for days (loops expire after 7 days and aren't restored on resume, --bg doesn't survive reboot, compaction loses detail — Codex goal completes early after compaction).
- **Decision:** `bitacora.py run` supervisor: state on disk (RUN.json), one fresh headless session per task (Haiku 5.5 + ultracode by default), external verify, caps and stuck detection in the supervisor, usage-limit backoff, autostart after reboot, Windows toast. Loop mode stays for hours-long work.
- **Alternatives:** one long /goal session (rejected: context rot, no reboot survival).
- **Consequences:** + days of unattended work with bounded risk / − more moving parts to maintain.

## D-007 — The bitácora lives in `~/bitacora`, outside the repo
- **Date:** 2026-10-13 · **Status:** Accepted · **Supersedes:** D-002 (bitácora location only)
- **Context:** Remote commit `4cfd74f` (2026-10-12) removes the embedded `bitacora/` from the repo, and `install.py` creates `~/bitacora` as a plain folder "never linked into this repo". Pushing the local legacy bitácora would have brought it back. 112 bitácora files changed locally since `07a8113` existed only on this machine.
- **Decision:** the live bitácora is `~/bitacora` (`$BITACORA_ROOT` overrides it). The monorepo keeps `skill/`, `evals/`, `install.py` and `README.md`; its history keeps the legacy `bitacora/` commits. The user approved the move, with a backup first.
- **Alternatives:** keep the bitácora embedded (rejected: contradicts `4cfd74f`); discard the 228 local commits (rejected: the only copy of 112 files; backed up instead); keep the history in a local branch only (rejected by the user, who chose to push it).
- **Consequences:** + the repo's tip carries no bitácora, and the legacy history is on GitHub / − the live bitácora has no remote or backup yet (P-013), so sync between machines is undefined.

## D-008 — Pictures bitácora goes into the metodologia repo (full copy)
- **Date:** 2026-10-13 · **Status:** Accepted · **Supersedes:** D-007 (pictures project only)
- **Context:** The owner asked for the pictures bitácora to be part of the `metodologia` repo, not a separate repo. D-007 had moved the whole bitácora out of the repo.
- **Decision:** `bitacora/pictures/` in the `metodologia` repo receives a full copy of `~/bitacora/pictures`. Git ignore rules still apply, so the casos photos stay out. The commit is local; nothing is pushed until the owner decides. `~/bitacora/pictures` stays the live copy until one link is chosen.
- **Alternatives:** keep it in `~/bitacora` (D-007); move the whole bitácora into the repo (not requested); let the bitácora code push after each commit (rejected: `push_async` would publish `main` automatically).
- **Consequences:** + one versioned copy of pictures in the methodology history / − two copies until the live one is linked; the repo copy is a snapshot at its commit.
- **Source:** [day log](2026-10/W3/2026-10-13.md) · P-013

## D-009 — Integrate the other clone's bitácora into the repo (owner's choice)
- **Date:** 2026-10-13 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Commits `c683665` ("bitacora: moved back into the metodologia monorepo (temporary)") and `1a72518` ("pictures: reconstruction …") from another clone of the repo (10:20 and 10:44 -05:00) reached `origin/main` while the local pictures commit `c1e39c0` was ready. The push was rejected as non-fast-forward. No clone of the repo exists on this machine except this one.
- **Decision:** integrate them (merge `904a1e7`). The repo now carries the bitácora of 16 top-level entries, including four projects that are not in `~/bitacora`. On the nine add/add conflicts in `bitacora/pictures` the local copy was kept; the other clone's versions stay in history (`c683665`, `1a72518`).
- **Alternatives:** keep `c1e39c0` local (not chosen by the owner); take the other clone's pictures and drop the local copy (not recommended: 3546 lines of ours would be missing).
- **Consequences:** + one complete history on GitHub / − contradicts D-007 for the projects not in `~/bitacora`; repo copies and the live copies can diverge; the other clone must be stopped before it pushes again.

## D-010 — Keep the other clone's bitácora copies; the other agent does the controlled merge
- **Date:** 2026-10-13 · **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** After D-009 the repo copies of eventos, maros, metodologia and signature-extraction, which come from the other clone, may differ from the live copies in `~/bitacora`.
- **Decision:** keep the repo copies as they are. Nothing is aligned from this session. The controlled merge between both sides is done by the other agent, which the owner put in charge of it. The live copies stay unchanged until it finishes (P-015).
- **Alternatives:** align the live copies to the repo from here (rejected: it would overwrite them without review); align the repo to the live copies from here (rejected: the same problem on the other side).
- **Consequences:** + no data is lost while the merge is pending; one owner for the merge / − the divergence stays until the merge is done.
