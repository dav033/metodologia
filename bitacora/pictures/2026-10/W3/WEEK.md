# pictures — Week 2026-10 W3 (2026-10-12 → 2026-10-18)

_Rewritten at the end of each session that week. Set `status: final` once the week is over and rolled up._

## Highlights
- Development resumed on the laptop and REQ-015 judge fixes reached a locally verified feature branch; all 10 gate suites pass.

## Done
- Reconciled local clone and marathon records. Existing branch has 21 commits over tracked origin/main; T12 and audit #3 corrections are integrated as uncommitted changes.
- Fixed selected-idea chips with an unrelated open plan, restored quote parity, and mixed round/Link-O-Loon color counts. Both independent review axes approve the corrections; P-076 closed.
- Confirmed stale generated development route types caused the historical typecheck errors. Recoverable backup retained; source types and app build pass without weakening checks.

## Decisions
- D-040 temporary bitácora location in metodologia; D-041 laptop development; D-043 canned-chip fallback by rules; D-044 durable hourly quote cap with bounded memory fallback.

## Not done / dropped
- No new commit, push, merge, deploy, paid journey or production migration in the REQ-015 close-out. Full selected-idea browser journey remains a proposed test; historical test debt is separate.

## Carried over to next week
- Owner reviews local changes before commit/publication; P-077 calibrates the default quote cap, P-075 retains historical tests to reproduce separately. Current evidence: [REQ-015 report](../../requirements/REQ-015-judge-fix-guided-chat-honesty-and-count/REPORT.md).
